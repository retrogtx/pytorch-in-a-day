# Learn PyTorch for deep learning in a day. Literally.

**This repository documents my learning journey as I explore PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library, through a comprehensive YouTube tutorial to be a machine learning engineer.**

This is just a follow along with the exercises. I watched the tutorial back in 2022, then slacked off.   
Uploading the code I had left on my PC, and now back to complete it once & for all. 

Building in public will keep me accountable, I guess.

Nothing beats the original [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A&t=3781s).

The [github repo](https://dbourke.link/pt-github) is a helpful resource too.
